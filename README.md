## Rationale

[Laravel Excel](https://laravel-excel.com) is an amazing package and I highly recommend it. One problem I've had with it comes from using [PhpSpreadsheet](https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/): working with really big datasets requires a lot of memory, even when the exports/imports are chunked. Some of the features provided by PhpSpreadsheet, like cell mapping and formulas, require it to hold entire document represented by objects in memory.

This package use [Openspout](https://github.com/openspout/openspout) (formerly known as Box Spout) to easy and performant Excel exports and imports in Laravel.

## Features

- **Easily export** from different sources: an array, Laravel Collection or query, to different supported formats (CSV, ODS, TSV, XLSX)

- **Supercharged imports** import of workbooks and worksheets to Eloquent models with batch inserts! Have large files? Your entire import can happen in the background. If you like, you can even handle each row youself!

- **Memory efficient.** Using Box Spout allows this package to use considerably less memory than some alternatives.

Compared to Laravel Excel, this package provides less features because it uses a different library for working with spreadsheets under the hood. However it assures that exports and imports are fast and require less memory.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require rabiloo/laravel-simplesheet
```
